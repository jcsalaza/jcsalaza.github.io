          <p>Peer pairing is an important part of being a programmer and a necessary part of our learning experience. We'll be working in pairs in the real world once we have our skills and are setting up our careers as coders, so we need to be prepared. As our title says, "two heads are better than one." With two people working on a single project, there is less room for error and more room for creativity. Not much left to be said so...pair up!</p>
          <p>Working together, I was so surprised how fast we were both able to create something together. Quick discussion allowed us to figure out what we wanted to do and how. I thought it would take longer working in a group, but it was extremely fluid. Discussing and mapping out the layout together really helped us put it all together. The only thing that didnâ€™t work, was that we didn't really take enough time to discuss the content prior to attacking the project. But it still worked out great.
