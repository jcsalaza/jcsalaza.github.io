	<h1>Well, here is a little about me:</h1>
		<p>Firstly, I'm from Redlands, CA and live in Los Angeles. I recently quit my job at a tech company that makes government HR software to become a developer!</p>
	<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p><em>Why?! Because it's the future, man!</em> But, really, I see every industry becoming more and more reliant on computers, software, and apps for everything from the smallest to the largest tasks. Not only do I want to be a part of that transformation, but I also want to be able to learn a new skill - and a skill that will allow me to understand the inner workings of these things that I rely on each day.</p>
	<h3>Afterwards?</h3>
		<p>My original reason for learning to code is that it would give me a new skill on my utility belt to help me launch my own business someday. <strong>But</strong> I also like the idea that I could use this skill to live/work elsewhere around the world!</p>
