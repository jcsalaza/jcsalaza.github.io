    <p class="center">About Me</p>
    <p>I'm from Redlands, CA originally, and I now live in Marina del Rey, CA. I worked for a year at a software company that makes HR software for the government, but I recently quit to pursue software development.</p><p>Someday I hope to own my own business, and I think learning to code could be helpful. If not, it's what I want to do for my career until I someday own my own business.</p><p>I want to travel the world, and I'm on well on my way. I've lived in Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Chiang Mai in Thailand for extended periods of time, and I have no intention of quitting my quest around the world. In fact, I hope that coding will allow me to live and work abroad. Maybe someday I'll actually be able to fulfill my dream of having Anthony Bourdain's job.</p><br><p>But that's enough about me! Feel free to read my posts to find out what I'm doing/thinking while I learn to become a developer at the Dev Boot Camp in NYC.</p>
