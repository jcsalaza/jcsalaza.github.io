    <p>Everyone has their own values and veliefs that characterize who they are to themselves as well as to other people. Of the long list above, the three that stand out to me as self-defining are ambition, adventure, and movement. These three kind of go together in my mind also. I feel like you should never be stagnant, you should always be moving. In order to keep moving, you need to be inspired, you need to have a fire under you for one reason or another. This is where ambition comes into play. Also, you need to not be scared by new things but rather excited and ready to meet them head on. That's where adventure comes into play. I hold all three values close to my heart, and they define who I am and what I want to do. It's because of these three values that I wanted to learn to code, move across the country, and, hopefully, find a job as a developer somewhere abroad.</p>
    <p>If I had to choose just one of those three, though, it would be movement. I can't stay in one place for long without getting bored or wanting something more. Partially, it's probably because there is so much to see in this world, and I know that so I don't want to waste time waiting around. My favorite animal is the shark. A fun fact about sharks is, from the time they're born, they don't stop moving. They can't. If they do, they sink. They're also only moving forward because sharks can't swim backwards. They're always moving, and moving forward to the next thing. I urge you to be like a shark sometimes too.</p>
    <p>If I had to rate it, the values I chose would rate like this:<br>Movement - 4<br>Ambition - 4<br>Adventure - 4<br>Why not "5"s for all of them? Because I also don't think you should ever take life too seriously, you should enjoy yourself while moving forward on your ambitious adventure.<br>I'm visiting my buddy in San Francisco right now, and he asked my advice on what he should next because he isn't too fond of his current career situation. I told him that he never has to settle and can move into something new if he wanted to. He just has to have the ambition, be ready for the adventure, and make moves.</p>
    <p>I don't really think any of my values could prevent stereotype threat for me or for anyone else, but I do think they're important to have a fulfilled life. Any time I'm feeling down at DBC, I'll just go on my own little adventure to jumpstart my mind back into ambitious, adventurous mode so I can get to moving again towards my end goal - being a coding ninja.</p>
