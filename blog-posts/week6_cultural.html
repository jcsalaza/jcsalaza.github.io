    <p class="center">Stereotype Threat</p>
    <p>I have to admit, I may not be the best person to explain stereotype threat based on personal experiences. It just so happens I was born a white male, a privileged category I've learned, and I never really had too many problems in school, social situations, or aywhere for that matter because of my race or gender. That being said, I've had my fair share of situations that conflict with my identity and make me awkward. These scenarios I'm about to describe are likely trivial compared to those who have experienced prejudice based on their race or gender, but they're my experiences. I'll try to use them as best I can to describe stereotype threat and offer some advice on what to do to avoid or reduce stereotype threat in your life and the lives of those around you.</p>
    <p><blockquote>[PAUSE]...Actually you know what, I feel stereotype threat right now! It's not a part of my personality but rather an effect of my current situation. I know that, as a white male, something is expected of me. In this case, where we are asked to write about our experiences with stereotypes, I know most people are going to expect me to say I haven't experienced stereotypes. Guess what happened...(see above!)</blockquote></p>
    <p>Anyways, I may not have experienced too many setbacks due to my race or gender, but I definitely have based on age. Likely, many of us have at some point or another because everyone was young once. In my personal example, it's in no specific setting but just about everywhere. Work, school, dating scene, restaurants and bars (before getting into bars especially lol). Why? Because I've always looked about five years younger than I am. Blessing or a curse? Time will tell. Either way, it doesn't help to be seen as someone who still needs to be looked after or someone who is immature no matter where you go. You have surely heard the old saying "treat your elders with respect," but you've also heard "treat others as you would want to be treated." So why is it then that it's acceptable for older people to automatically decide someone younger than them is less worthy of respect purely based on age? It shouldn't be ok, and yet it happens to young people every day. In fact, it's one of the main reasons I left my last career. I saw that it was a situation where, because you had to essentially trade time for respect, I wouldn't be seen as someone who could contribute valuable information until I was like one of the older people who had already put in their time. An example scenario where I felt I had fallen to stereotype threat would be in a company meeting. Sure I had ideas to change things about the current protocol to attempt to make the processes more efficient, but I knew I wasn't expected to put them forth (and I thought maybe they wouldn't have been welcomed) because I was a young guy. So, in meetings where the average age was ten or so years older than my age, I kept quiet. In a smaller team meeting where others in the room were about my age, though, I felt my ideas would be better suited to be shared.</p>
    <p>Now for the one that's a little surprising...<br>I'm 25% Mexican, but the 75% white boy shines through strong. Sometimes, when I meet new (white) people, I like to say the only Mexican thing about me is my last name, which is "Salazar." But wait one second! That's stereotype threat right there. I know I'm expected to identify as white and white alone because that's what I look like. When it comes up, I often brush it under the rug and/or make it a joke because I don't want to have to explain myself. After all, I had no choice over my heritage or my last name, I was given them by default because I was born to my parents specifically. It's a different scenario when I'm around my Mexican friends or family, though. All of a sudden, I'm super Mexican! I know they see me as partially Mexican, so I subconsciously embrace that, I guess, and tone it up rather than down. It's a strange thing really, I know that in reality I'm a quarter Mexican, but my identity changes based on the scenario and my actions and what I say may change drastically depending on how I think I'm expected to behave.</p>
    <p>How someone behaves and who they are in their mind are often in flux. Identity can be situational, as learned from Claude Steele, the originator of the stereotype threat theories. A woman may perform more poorly on a driving exam with a male instructor than a female instructor because they might feel they are expected to not be as competent a driver in male eyes versus female eyes. However, I've also learned that this has a lot to do with internal factors as well as external. Not every woman is going to perform more poorly in the example I just used, but it may be more likely in that scenario.<br>In more exact terms, the threat is present in that situation to feel inferior as a driver based on gender alone. Due to its presence, the outcomes of that scenario may be different and skewed towards the expectations of the stereotype.</p>
    <p>I think the best thing we can do is be mindful of when we're in a situation where we might be either the cause or the victim of stereotype threat. Once we're mindful of the thought crossing our mind or that our normal actions have changed based on our circumstances, we can remind ourselves that everyone is different and everyone is capable of defining themselves.<br>Not every Asian person is good at math and bad at driving. Once we see how ridiculous it is to assign a stereotype like that and generalize an entire group of unique people, we can then avoid being the cause of stereotype threat. Once we have realized that about our own identities as well, we can avoid being the victim of stereotype threat. All in all, there's no way to get rid of stereotypes completely because it's human nature to categorize things. However, we can at least start with the "man [or woman] in the mirror" because, as MJ so eloquently put it, "if you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make a change!"</p>
