    <p class="center">My 3 Favorite Sites</p>
    <p>My first favorite website is <em>Reddit</em>. Why? It's simplicity for the most part. A site where everyone who posts content decides what's most important is a great idea on its own, and you really can find some of the funniest as well as the most interesting things on the Internet on that site. I'd say the site is simple, functional, efficient, easy to navigate, and most importantly fun. Nothing too awe inspiring about its design, but it gets the job done and serves an important purpose of being the most grassroots form of getting the news, whether that news is world news or news about a new video game. It's a list of links and descriptions, and it is easy to browse. After a long time on Reddit, you usually feel like you've wasted time, but, in the end, I always, personally, come away from it having learned something new.</p>
    <p>My second favorite website is <em>AskMen</em>. It's fun, informative, instructional (sometimes), simple, and it can be enjoyed by both men and women regardless of the name. It's a great homepage - the perfect balance of simplicity and organization through media. After the annoying ads that pop up without fail, you see a homepage with either a featured article reel or an ad with lots of little square-shaped containers that link to all sorts of articles. It's similar to Reddit in its simplicity, and I like that it incorporates media in the form of photos or videos throughout the site. That incorporation makes it more palatable to not-so-somputer-savvy consumers. I'm not entirely sure, but I think they sell things through their website now as well. I get a newsletter from the site weekly with a ton of featured products, so they're making money regardless of if they're selling anything. I think, if they do sell products on their site, that a good percentage of their audience would at least consider buying something.</p>
    <p>My third favorite site is <em>Tiny Buddha</em>. It's a bit more jumbled and complex than the other two, but it's similar in a way and gets the job done. It's still informative and instructional, but it's also inspirational and positive, and, of course, it's SIMPLE. Though it looks disorganized at first, it's just a bunch of divs or containers of some sort that link to articles. It's a good way to waste time, but not too much comes from aside from inspiration and positivity. Not bad results though, if you ask me. I think their mission and their design might be related in that they're both a bit disorganized, but it is a great site for its simplicity and for the feeling you get from reading the content.</p>
