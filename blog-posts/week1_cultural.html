    <p>I think Mr. Bishay is on to something. Traditional ways of learning are often boring and time consuming. It's part of why DBC was interesting to me in the first place. I want to be able to learn how something works rather than just enjoy the benefits of it, but I don't want to spend four years learning a whole slew of things that I may not end up using. DBC allows me to learn a new, useful skill efficiently, so I'm ready to use that skill as soon as possible and continue learning. DBC is aligned with my credo "Constant And Never Ending Improvement" for that reason.</p>
    <p>After watching the video, I realized it reminded me of Tim Ferris's 4 Hour Chef. Mr. Ferris challenges his readers to learn any skill to further appreciate the benefits of it. The 4 Hour Chef focuses on cooking, and Tim Ferris explains how his view and appreciation of food has changed now that he has mastered cooking skills. The kitchen vs. restaurant mindset is pretty much directly related to this idea. Code is just that, a code, to me right now; it's a whole other language. But learning to code is a skill that no way can take away regardless of if there's a piece of paper to prove I've learned it. Though I'm still a super novice, learning what I have so far has been motivating. I'm starting to appreciate the sites and apps I see so much more knowing how much has gone into them, and I want to be able to not only see the entire spectrum of color but be able to manipulate it as well.</p>
    <p>As I said before, I'm inspired by self-improvement and want to continue learning new skills throughout my life. At this point in my life, DBC is the avenue for learning to code. I'm not entirely sure what I'll be doing with it just yet, but it's a skill I'm interested in mastering and a great one to have on any "utility belt."</p>
    <p>After watching the video and hearing some more about how intensive DBC is and will be, I'm definitely nervous. Not scared, but kind of anxious in a good way, like the way you get nervous before stepping onto a stage before a big speech. DO I think I'll be able to handle it? Well, who can really tell? But I've never been one to back down from a challenge. I'm a hands-on person, and this is a hands-on program. It sounds like my kind of an environment more and more, and I'm ready to see what's in store.</p>
