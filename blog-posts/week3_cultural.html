    <p class="center">Abstract Random? That's Random.</p>
    <p>Apparently I'm an Abstract Random (AR) learner according to the Gregorc thinking styles. At first, this was a surprise to me because I consider myself very logical, and I often like to think through things step-by-step logically. I originally pinned myself as the opposite end of the spectrum - Concrete Sequential.</p>
    <p>I did a lot of research on what kind of a person is an AR thinker, and I definitely see some of myself in some of those qualities. However, I also see a lot of myself in Abstract Sequential too, and, in fact, in each of the categories. For example, I align with AR in that I don't like dictatorial/authoritarian environments or restrictive environments (but who does?) and in that I'm more of a people person and enjoy social environments. Also, I have trouble explaining or justifying my feelings which is an AR quality apparently. However, especially when it comes to working, I think I'm much more Concrete Sequential in that I think very logically, step-by-step, linear. Also, I rely on my five senses (duh) when it comes to learning...(If you can't tell, I do not buy into this categorization).</p>
    <p>How is this going to help me at DBC? I have absolutely no idea. The Gregorc thinking styles really don't help me much. Though, it did make me think more of what kind of a person I am and in what environments I feel more comfortable learning.</p>
    <p><strong>What I do know is this</strong>: I'm a more hands-on learner. I learn best by doing and seeing not reading and listening. I also enjoy social environments with a lot of freedom to do things my way rather than <em>the</em> way. I think very logically, but I also keep other people in mind (their feelings, what they have to offer) if I'm working in a group.</p>
    <p>My biggest struggle in phase 0, so far, is learning things on my own without someone showing me how something works or why it's important to what I'll be doing. Reading about JavaScript to learn is a great example. I did not learn at all, or at least retain anything, from the readings, so I decided to take the CodeAcademy JavaScript course in addition to the reading. That actually helped me out a lot and prepared me enough for my GPS. Since I know that, my plan is to make sure I supplement my learning with doing.</p>
    <p>Now for growth vs fixed mindset - I'm growth mindset for sure. I think growth mindset translates into anyone who is trying to better themselves and understands that effort needs to be put in and obstacles need to be overcome to achieve that goal. My personal motto is "Constant and never ending improvement - CANEI." However, I do think I need to work on something to fully have a growth mindset. It's not that I'm not good at taking criticism so much as, if I don't believe it to be true too, I just disregard it and keep doing things my way. Especially when people give feedback just for the sake of it, I can tell it that it seems fake and I don't take it to mean anything and won't do anything with it.  I think what might help is maybe just failing at something and then getting affirmation from someone else that reflects that that's the case. That would fire me up to improve whatever it is that I failed at. So I guess, weirdly enough, that I like criticism rather than what people often refer to as "constructive" criticism because it makes me want to prove myself.</p>
    <p>In the end, I didn't learn too much about myself from the Gregorc thinking style, and I feel I'm already growth mindset with of things to work on. Well, Gregorc himself did say, "No one is a 'pure' style. Each of us have a unique combination of natural strengths and abilities." Now that's something I can agree with.</p>
