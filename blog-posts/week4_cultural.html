    <p class="center">Net Neutrality - And Why You Should Care!</p>
    <p>A big problem in the tech world that demands our immediate attention and action is net neutrality (also network neutrality, Internet neutrality, etc.). Without doing anything, we risk having some data on the Internet discriminated against based on type, owner, user, company, size, or pretty much anything! This would be devastating to tech companies because they would have to pay Internet service providers (ISPs) to get decent bandwidth to their users/consumers. That would not only hurt the profits made by the company, but it would hurt the users too. Us consumers already have to pay for different speeds when it comes to our Internet, but, now, we may not be able to enjoy some of the tech products and/or services we've come to rely on simply because the ISPs aren't getting a big enough piece of the pie from a company like Netflix and slow down or throttle their speeds based on how much they're paying.</p>
    <p>An example of what that means is this -<br>Netflix wants its consumers to be able to stream television shows and movies easily and without buffering. If they don't pay the ISPs, even if you have a gigabyte per second bandwidth that you're paying for, you may have to wait forever for your show to buffer because the ISP is throttling the speed at which Netflix can upload and run data on your computer. You get pissed because you cannot use your Netflix anymore like you used to, so you cancel your subscription. Many other customers do the same. Now Netflix subscriptions are not growing but shrinking and they begin to lose money. Netflix goes under, and you can't watch your shows like you used to because a brilliant business model was undermined by greed.</p>
    <p>Even worse, freedom of speech might be infringed in many cases like this one because the access to certain information is prevented by the ISPs if the company or curator does not comply with new pricing based on speed. All data on the Internet should be treated equally, and huge conglomerate telecommunication companies should probably be last on the list of those who should decide which sites can and cannot be accessed as easily.</p>
    <p>So, essentially telecom giants like AT&T and Comcast, want more money and feel justified that they should be able to charge both the sending and receiving end for the bandwidth speeds. That's like a panhandler in a Gucci suit getting money from you on the way in and the way out of your favorite store. Ok maybe that's a stretch, but you get the point - these ISPs are not suffering financially, and yet they want to charge every member of a transaction. If you do not comply, or if your business does not comply, you'll be coerced into going along with it because you/your business would suffer greatly if the ISP slowed down your speed. Consumers would likely quit using your product/service because the typical consumer of technology is not willing to wait forever for a video to buffer or a page to load.</p>
    <p>In short, the Internet as you know it will change drastically if something is not done. And for all of us who are wanting to do something in the tech industry, especially "wantrepreneurs," this is even more important to our future projects and careers.
