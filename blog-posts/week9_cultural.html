    <p class="center">The 3 C's</p>
    <p>Sometimes you hit a problem and you need to ask for help. However, asking the wrong questions can lead to more bewilderment than before! In trying to find answers to some coding questions during phase 0, for example, I've had to look through several Stack Overflow answers that don't pertain to the specific problem I was having. That can waste time and cause frsutration. Luckily, I had a teacher some years back that taught me something that has come in handy, especially with looking up coding questions or posing them on Stack Overflow or at DBC. This is the <strong>3 C's - Clear Concise Communication</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>The 1st C</strong><br>Clarity is very important in asking a question. After all, if the other party doesn't know what answer you're asking for, they may give you a different one even if they knew the corect answer. It's all in how you word the question. You can explain exactly the problem you're having, how you got there, what's happening when the problem arises, etc. All of this information can be helpful when asking a question. Be careful, though, you don't want to include all of it or people might think you take too much time in asking a question and not want to answer too many for you in the future. And this leads me to the the next point...</p>
    <p><strong>The 2nd C</strong><br>Concise. Your question needs to be clear, but it also needs to be concise. You don't want to waste anyone else's time, and you also don't want to waste your own. Especially online, people's attention span is getting shorter and shorter it seems. On a site like Stack Overflow, you'll want to be able to summarize your problem in a single sentence, if possible. You can get into the details in the description, and that's where you can be even more clear. In the title, though, that's where you need to be especially concise. The reason is this...well, it's actually the next C!</p>
    <p><strong>The 3rd C</strong><br>Communication. Even online where you can be anyone, it's communication. Take the other party into consideration when forming your question. Make sure it's clear enough for <em>them</em>. Make sure it's concise enough for <em>them</em>. We oftentimes fall into only thinking about ourselves and our own situations, and, when we run into a problem and need to ask a question, we can make that mistake even more so. Remember that it's a two way street. Choose your words wisely. Watch how you're encoding your message, and also watch its tone. Imagine how it might be decoded by the receiving end.</p>
    <p>If you can do all of these things, you're asking some pretty darn good questions, bub!<br>There's no shame in admitting you need help, and, most of the time, people are more willing to help you than you may think. Ask away, and try to abide by the three C's!</p>
