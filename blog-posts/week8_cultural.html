    <p class="center">Clean Conflict</p>
    <p>Most of the time, I think we all try to avoid conflict. Oftentimes, when we experience conflict, we can let our emotions get the better of us and do or say something we might regret. Rather than avoid conflict, though, we should be aware of when we are in a situation of conflict, try to understand why or what is the cause, and notice our emotions and understand why we're having them but not let them get the better of you. If you can do these three things, I think conflict can actually be a very constructive thing for friendships, relationships, between strangers, or whatever. I'd like to describe a situation of conflict I had and then explain how I could have handled it better.</p>
    <p>To start off my story, you need to understand that I'm a clean freak and a pretty serious one. Everything has a place and should be put away there when it's not being used. Plates, cups, dishes in general should be washed right after they're used. And, for God's sake, you need to throw away your trash so it's not out for other people to have to toss away! Now that you know this, you'll understand why I had a conflict with my not-so-clean roommate.</p>
    <p>The source of the conflict was that my one roommate would leave his dishes, trash, whatever he dirtied out for everyone else to clean up. I felt like a maid because I wanted the place clean, and my other roommates didn't like the unhygienic situation either. So, I decided to take advantage of the situation when my roommates and I were all at the house and my dirty roommate came back to a mess he had made earlier that week that still wasn't cleaned up. I told him he couldn't do that anymore, that it was gross, and that if any of us noticed him doing it again we'd put the mess in his room for him to clean up on his own time if that's how he wanted it.</p>
    <p>It sounded reasonable to me, but it sounded like an all-out attack to him. After the conversation heating up and progressing to a little altercation, we didn't speak for a little while. Obviously, my actions made things worse. Especially because he was my good friend and we hung out all the time. If I could go back, I would've decided to talk to him about it alone and then tell him how the others felt too. If he didn't like that, I'd then take it to intervention mode with the other roommates too. It was a surprise to him, I think, that all of us came out of nowhere to reprimand him. Maybe he was having a bad day too. Either way, I should've considered how he would feel about being attacked by a group like that.</p>
    <p>In the most simple terms, I learned that you should be considerate of others. I also learned that there is a better way to handle conflict than trying to overpower your "foe" and especially when that "foe" is a friend. You don't want to do something stupid and ruin a friendship, so you should keep your emotions under control. Notice them as they arise, understand them, and then act. Be aware of your situation, know when conflict is arising. See how you fit into the situation, decide if you are a cause in one way or another, and then try to fix the situation WITH the other involved party by discussing how their actions/words made you feel and why. Then, you'll at least have a much calmer and more rational situation of conflict.</p>
    <p><em>P.S. You don't have to worry, my buddy and I are as good of friends as ever. I just won't live with him again, but that's my own choice as a clean freak :)</em></p>
